# 🥷 GRPO Implementation Debrief Scroll

## Completed Missions

### 1. Core Architecture Decisions
- ✅ Adopted TRL's battle-tested GRPO implementation
- ✅ Established clear organizational policy against custom implementations
- ✅ Secured original log probability computation in `model.py`

### 2. Code Cleanup
- ✅ Removed custom GRPO trainer implementation
- ✅ Simplified `grpo_loss.py` to policy documentation
- ✅ Updated dataset class for TRL compatibility

### 3. Training Infrastructure
- ✅ Created `train_grpo_sa.py` with TRL integration
- ✅ Set up reward computation for SA + QED scores
- ✅ Configured training script with proper hyperparameters

## Incomplete Missions

### 1. On-Policy Training Pipeline
- ❌ Verify proper trajectory collection
- ❌ Ensure immediate policy updates after each batch
- ❌ Validate group-based advantage computation
- ❌ Confirm no trajectory reuse between updates

### 2. Model Integration
- ❌ Test compatibility between MolGPT and TRL's trainer
- ❌ Verify log probability computation alignment
- ❌ Ensure proper reference model state management

### 3. Monitoring Infrastructure
- ❌ Track KL divergence during training
- ❌ Monitor reward distribution
- ❌ Log policy updates and reference model changes
- ❌ Measure SA score improvements

## Next Surgical Strikes

### Phase 1: On-Policy Validation
1. Verify trajectory collection and immediate updates
2. Validate group sampling mechanism
3. Test reward computation in real-time
4. Ensure proper policy gradient updates

### Phase 2: Training Loop
1. Small-scale training with live monitoring
2. Track KL divergence and policy drift
3. Monitor group advantage computation
4. Verify reference model updates

### Phase 3: Full Deployment
1. Run full training with optimal parameters
2. Monitor live SA score improvements
3. Track policy evolution
4. Document convergence behavior

## Risk Analysis

### Known Risks
1. Policy collapse due to aggressive updates
2. High variance in advantage estimates
3. KL divergence instability
4. Reward sparsity issues

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Conservative initial learning rate
2. Proper advantage normalization
3. Careful KL penalty tuning
4. Regular policy checkpointing

## Success Metrics
- Improving mean SA scores during training
- Stable KL divergence throughout updates
- Maintained chemical validity in generated molecules
- Consistent group advantage learning signal
