# Ninja Scroll: DataFrame Return Fix

## Progress Report

Our fixes have been successful so far:

1. ✅ Fixed: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'train.utils'; 'train' is not a package`
2. ✅ Fixed: `ImportError: cannot import name 'SmileDataset' from partially initialized module 'dataset'`
3. ✅ Fixed: `RuntimeError: Parent directory ../cond_gpt/weights does not exist.`

## New Error Detected

```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to_csv'
```

This error occurs at line 140 in train/train.py:
```python
df.to_csv(f'{args.run_name}.csv', index=False)
```

The `df` variable is None, which means the `trainer.train(wandb)` function is returning None instead of a DataFrame.

## Code Analysis

Let's check the trainer.py file to understand why the train method is returning None instead of a DataFrame.

## Ninja Fix Plan

Following the Way of the Code Ninja, I will:

1. Examine the `train` method in trainer.py to understand why it's returning None
2. Make a surgical fix to ensure it returns a DataFrame as expected
3. If needed, add a fallback in train.py to handle the case where df is None

This will ensure the code can complete successfully without crashing.
