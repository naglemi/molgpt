# SMILES Parse Error Suppression

## Issue Identification

During the execution of the MolGPT training process, numerous SMILES parsing error messages are being printed to the console:

```
[00:12:00] SMILES Parse Error: unclosed ring for input: 'CCpCCC=CCCC(CCCOC=CCCCC1CCCCO[NH+]C(C)C)C'
[00:12:00] SMILES Parse Error: extra open parentheses for input: 'CC(CC)C(C=C[NH+]C[NH+]CCCCC=C)CCC(CCCC(CCCC(C'
...
```

These errors are expected and handled by the code, but they flood the console output, making it difficult to see other important information.

## Root Cause Analysis

The error messages are coming from RDKit's internal error handling when it tries to parse invalid SMILES strings. The code is already handling these errors by catching exceptions and returning None or empty strings for invalid molecules, but the error messages are still being printed to the console.

The main locations where SMILES parsing occurs:

1. In `moses/utils.py`, the `get_mol` function uses `Chem.MolFromSmiles` and `Chem.SanitizeMol` to convert SMILES strings to molecules.
2. In `train/grpo_loss.py`, the `MolecularRewardFunction` class uses `Chem.MolFromSmiles` to convert SMILES strings to molecules.
3. In `train/grpo_trainer.py`, the `_sample_molecules` and `_generate_samples` methods use `get_mol` and `Chem.MolToSmiles` to work with SMILES strings.

## Solution Approach

To silence these error messages without affecting functionality, we need to configure RDKit's logging system to suppress these specific error messages. RDKit uses a C++ logging system that can be configured from Python.

The most surgical approach is to add a small piece of code at the beginning of our main script to configure RDKit's logging level before any SMILES parsing occurs.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add code to configure RDKit's logging level in `train/train.py` since that's the entry point for our training process.
2. Set RDKit's logging level to ERROR or higher to suppress the SMILES parsing warnings.
3. Test the change to ensure it doesn't affect functionality.

## Code Changes

Add the following code at the beginning of `train/train.py`, after the imports but before any code execution:

```python
# Configure RDKit to suppress SMILES parsing errors
from rdkit import RDLogger
RDLogger.DisableLog('rdApp.*')
```

This will disable all RDKit logging messages, which includes the SMILES parsing errors.
