# ðŸ¥· Ninja Scroll: GRPO Integration Status ðŸ¥·

## Overview

This ninja scroll documents the current state of the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) integration with MolGPT. After careful examination of the codebase, I've found that most of the GRPO components are already implemented and ready to use.

## Existing GRPO Components

The following components are already implemented in the codebase:

1. **GRPO Loss Function** (`train/grpo_loss.py`):
   - `GRPOLoss` class for computing the GRPO loss with clipped surrogate objective and KL divergence penalty
   - `MolecularRewardFunction` class for calculating rewards based on molecular properties
   - `create_reference_model` function for creating a frozen copy of the model to serve as reference

2. **GRPO Trainer** (`train/grpo_trainer.py`):
   - `GRPOTrainerConfig` class extending the standard TrainerConfig with GRPO-specific parameters
   - `GRPOTrainer` class implementing the GRPO training loop with molecule sampling and reward calculation

3. **GRPO Utilities** (`train/grpo_utils.py`):
   - `PPOLoss` class implementing a PPO-style loss function for GRPO
   - `create_reference_model` function for creating a frozen copy of the model
   - `compute_normalized_rewards` function for normalizing rewards within a batch

4. **Reward Functions** (`train/rewards.py`):
   - `SimilarityReward` class for calculating rewards based on molecular similarity
   - `PropertyReward` class for calculating rewards based on molecular properties

5. **Model Modifications** (`train/model.py`):
   - The `forward` method of the `GPT` class has been modified to support returning log probabilities and token-level log probabilities when `return_log_probs=True`

6. **Training Scripts**:
   - `train_grpo.py`: Main script for GRPO fine-tuning
   - `train_grpo_test.py`: Test script for GRPO

## Fixed Issues

1. **Import Error in dataset.py**:
   - Fixed the import statement in `train/dataset.py` from `from train.utils import SmilesEnumerator` to `from utils import SmilesEnumerator`
   - This allows the code to run properly when executed with `python train/train.py`

## GRPO Integration Completeness

The GRPO integration appears to be complete and ready to use. The implementation follows the approach outlined in the `molgpt_grpo_integration.md` file:

1. **Reference Model Creation**: Implemented in both `train/grpo_loss.py` and `train/grpo_utils.py`
2. **Logit Extraction and Probability Calculation**: Implemented in the `forward` method of the `GPT` class
3. **Reward Function Implementation**: Implemented in `train/grpo_loss.py` and `train/rewards.py`
4. **Group-Based Sampling**: Implemented in the `_sample_molecules` method of the `GRPOTrainer` class

## Usage Instructions

To use GRPO for fine-tuning a pre-trained MolGPT model:

1. Train a base MolGPT model using the standard training script:
   ```bash
   python train/train.py --run_name base_model --data_name moses2 --batch_size 384 --max_epochs 10
   ```

2. Fine-tune the pre-trained model using GRPO:
   ```bash
   python train_grpo.py --model_path weights/base_model.pt --reward_type qed --max_epochs 5
   ```

3. Generate molecules with the fine-tuned model:
   ```bash
   # The train_grpo.py script includes generation functionality at the end
   ```

## Conclusion

The GRPO integration with MolGPT is complete and follows the approach outlined in the `molgpt_grpo_integration.md` file. The implementation includes all the necessary components for fine-tuning MolGPT models using GRPO to optimize towards specific molecular properties.

The code is now ready to be used for fine-tuning pre-trained MolGPT models with GRPO.
