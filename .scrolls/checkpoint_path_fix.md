# Ninja Scroll: Checkpoint Path Fix

## Progress Report

Our surgical fix for the circular import issue was successful! The code now runs past the initial import errors:

1. ✅ Fixed: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'train.utils'; 'train' is not a package`
2. ✅ Fixed: `ImportError: cannot import name 'SmileDataset' from partially initialized module 'dataset'`

## New Error Detected

```
RuntimeError: Parent directory ../cond_gpt/weights does not exist.
```

This error occurs when the trainer tries to save the model checkpoint. The path `../cond_gpt/weights` doesn't exist in the current project structure.

## Code Analysis

In `train/trainer.py`, line 69:
```python
torch.save(raw_model.state_dict(), self.config.ckpt_path)
```

The `ckpt_path` is set in `train/train.py`, line 133-135:
```python
tconf = TrainerConfig(max_epochs=args.max_epochs, batch_size=args.batch_size, learning_rate=args.learning_rate,
                      lr_decay=True, warmup_tokens=0.1*len(train_data)*max_len, final_tokens=args.max_epochs*len(train_data)*max_len,
                      num_workers=10, ckpt_path=f'../cond_gpt/weights/{args.run_name}.pt', block_size=train_dataset.max_len, generate=False)
```

## Ninja Fix Plan

Following the Way of the Code Ninja, I will make a precise, surgical fix:

1. **Create a local weights directory**: Instead of using `../cond_gpt/weights/`, we'll use a local `weights/` directory in the current project.

2. **Update the checkpoint path in train/train.py**: Change the path to use the local weights directory.

This minimal change will allow the model to save checkpoints without modifying the core functionality.
