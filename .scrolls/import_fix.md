# ðŸ¥· Ninja Scroll: Import Path Fix ðŸ¥·

## Issue Detection

The ninja has detected an import error in the MolGPT codebase:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'train.utils'; 'train' is not a package
```

This error occurs when running `train/train.py` because the import statement in `train/dataset.py` is trying to import from `train.utils` as if `train` is a package, but when running the script directly with `python train/train.py`, the `train` directory is not recognized as a package in the import path.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from conflicting import strategies:

1. In `train/dataset.py`:
   ```python
   from train.utils import SmilesEnumerator
   ```

2. In `train/train.py`:
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       from dataset import SmileDataset
   ```

The `train/train.py` script is importing `dataset` as a local module, but `dataset.py` is trying to import `utils` as a submodule of the `train` package.

## Surgical Fix Plan

The ninja will make a precise, minimal change to fix the import path issue:

1. Modify `train/dataset.py` to use a direct import instead of a package-relative import:
   ```python
   from utils import SmilesEnumerator  # Changed from 'train.utils'
   ```

This change aligns with how the code is being executed in the `ninjatest.sh` script, which sets `PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/molgpt` before running the Python script.

## Verification Strategy

After applying the fix, the ninja will run `./ninjatest.sh` again to verify that the import error is resolved and the code can proceed further in execution.

## Long-term Considerations

For a more robust solution in the future, the project could:

1. Consistently use relative imports (e.g., `from .utils import SmilesEnumerator`)
2. Ensure the project is properly installed as a package
3. Use a consistent import strategy throughout the codebase

However, the current fix is the most surgical and minimal change needed to resolve the immediate issue.
