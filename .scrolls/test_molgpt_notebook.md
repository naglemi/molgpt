# ðŸ¥· Ninja Scroll: MolGPT Notebook Testing ðŸ¥·

## Objective
Test the MolGPT_Cowboy_Chronicle.ipynb notebook to ensure it runs successfully via nbconvert and produces sensible results.

## Observations
1. The notebook demonstrates a complete workflow for MolGPT including setup, training, generation, and evaluation.
2. The notebook requires access to:
   - `train` module for model definition and training
   - `generate` module for molecular generation
   - `moses` module for molecule evaluation
   - `datasets` directory for data and pre-trained weights

3. Pre-trained model weights are available in `datasets/weights/` directory.
4. Sample datasets are available in `datasets/` directory.

## Potential Issues
1. Data availability: The notebook references a moses2.csv file which appears truncated in the repo.
2. Path references: Model weight paths may need adjustment.
3. Execution time: Full training would be time-consuming.

## Testing Strategy
1. Create a testing script that uses nbconvert to execute the notebook.
2. Modify paths in the notebook to point to available files.
3. Skip or limit the training section for faster execution.
4. Verify that molecule generation and visualization works.
5. Check for errors and handle them appropriately.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a test script that:
   - Sets up the proper Python environment
   - Uses nbconvert to execute the notebook
   - Captures and logs output
   - Verifies results

2. If necessary, create a modified version of the notebook with:
   - Proper path references
   - Limited training iterations
   - Added validation steps

3. Execute the test and analyze results.

## Success Criteria
1. Notebook executes without errors.
2. Generated molecules are valid.
3. Visualizations are produced correctly.
4. Property conditions influence molecule generation as expected.
