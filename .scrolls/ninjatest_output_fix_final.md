# Ninja Scroll: Successful Implementation of ninjatest.sh Output Handling

## Target
The task was to modify the `ninjatest.sh` script to prevent it from displaying the entire standard output directly, which was consuming too many tokens for the API.

## Implementation Summary
Following the Way of the Code Ninja, I made a precise, surgical modification to the `ninjatest.sh` script to:

1. Run the Python script with `nohup` in the background
2. Redirect all output to a file named `training.log`
3. Display only the last 500 lines of the log file using `tail -n 500`

The final implementation:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Simple test script to verify the import fix
# Only runs the first command from train_moses.sh to test the fix
# Output is redirected to training.log to reduce token consumption

# Run the Python script with nohup and redirect output to training.log
PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/molgpt nohup python train/train.py --run_name test_fix --data_name moses2 --batch_size 384 --max_epochs 1 --num_props 0 > training.log 2>&1 &

# Wait a moment for the process to start
sleep 2

# Display the last 500 lines of the log file
echo "Displaying last 500 lines of training.log. Full log available in training.log"
tail -n 500 training.log

# Inform about how to check the log
echo ""
echo "To check the latest log entries, use: tail -n 500 training.log"
```

## Verification
The script was tested and confirmed to be working correctly:

1. The Python script runs in the background with `nohup`
2. Output is successfully redirected to `training.log`
3. The log file shows the training process is running as expected
4. Only a limited portion of the log is displayed, reducing token consumption

## Benefits
This implementation:
- Maintains the core functionality of the script
- Reduces token consumption by limiting the output displayed
- Allows for monitoring the training progress through the log file
- Follows the pattern mentioned by the user as being used in the parent directory's `fine_tune_MIDI` folder

The fix adheres to the Creed of the Code Ninja by being precise, minimal, and surgical in addressing the specific issue.
