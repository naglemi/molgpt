# Ninja Scroll: Fixing ninjatest.sh Output Handling - Updated

## Target
The current `ninjatest.sh` script outputs all standard output directly, consuming too many tokens for the API. 

## Analysis
The initial fix encountered an error:
```
nohup: failed to run command 'PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/molgpt': No such file or directory
```

This occurred because I incorrectly placed the environment variable setting (`PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/molgpt`) as the command for `nohup`. The correct approach is to use `nohup` with the actual command (python) and set the environment variable either before or as part of the command execution.

## Ninja Plan
Following the Way of the Code Ninja, I will make a precise, surgical modification to the `ninjatest.sh` script to:

1. Correctly use `nohup` with the Python command
2. Set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable properly
3. Redirect all output to a file named `training.log`
4. Add a command to display only the last 500 lines of the log file using `tail -n 500`

This approach will:
- Fix the error in the previous implementation
- Maintain the core functionality of the script
- Reduce token consumption by limiting the output displayed
- Allow for monitoring the training progress through the log file

## Implementation
The modified script will:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Simple test script to verify the import fix
# Only runs the first command from train_moses.sh to test the fix
# Output is redirected to training.log to reduce token consumption

# Run the Python script with nohup and redirect output to training.log
PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/molgpt nohup python train/train.py --run_name test_fix --data_name moses2 --batch_size 384 --max_epochs 1 --num_props 0 > training.log 2>&1 &

# Wait a moment for the process to start
sleep 2

# Display the last 500 lines of the log file
echo "Displaying last 500 lines of training.log. Full log available in training.log"
tail -n 500 training.log

# Inform about how to check the log
echo ""
echo "To check the latest log entries, use: tail -n 500 training.log"
```

This implementation follows the Creed of the Code Ninja by being precise, minimal, and surgical in addressing the specific issue.
